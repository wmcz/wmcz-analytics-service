# wmcz-datasets-maintainer

This repository is a part of a future WMCZ Analytics service. It contains orchestrating code that runs on Wikimedia Toolforge, downloading datasets generated elsewhere and generating new datasets (via sister-repository [wmcz-datasets-generator](https://github.com/wmcz/wmcz-datasets-generator)).

Datasets published via this repository can be accessed from https://wmcz.toolforge.org/datasets/.
